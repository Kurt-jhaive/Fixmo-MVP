## File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ booking-manager.js        # Main booking management logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ booking-manager.css       # Booking system styles
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ booking-page-template.html    # HTML template (for reference)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controller/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ appointmentController.js      # Existing appointment controller (reused)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ route/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bookingRoute.js               # Express routes that wrap appointment endpoints
```

**Note**: The booking system reuses your existing `appointmentController.js` to maintain consistency and avoid code duplication. The `bookingRoute.js` file provides booking-specific endpoints that internally call the appointment controller methods.

## API Endpoints

### Provider Bookings
- `GET /api/bookings/provider` - Get all bookings for authenticated provider (uses existing appointment controller)
- `GET /api/bookings/provider/stats` - Get booking statistics
- `GET /api/bookings/:appointmentId` - Get specific booking details (uses existing appointment controller)
- `PUT /api/bookings/:appointmentId/status` - Update booking status (uses existing appointment controller)
- `PUT /api/bookings/:appointmentId/reschedule` - Reschedule booking

### Integration with Existing Controllers
The booking system leverages your existing `appointmentController.js` to ensure data consistency and avoid duplication. It wraps the existing appointment endpoints with booking-specific functionality while maintaining the same data structure.

## Database Integration

The system uses your existing `Appointment` table from Prisma with the following relationships:
- **Customer**: Linked to `User` model
- **Service Provider**: Linked to `ServiceProviderDetails` model  
- **Service**: Linked to `ServiceListing` model
- **Availability**: Linked to `Availability` model
- **Ratings**: Linked to `Rating` model

### Real Data from Database
All booking data comes directly from your `Appointment` table in the database. No mock data is used - the system fetches real appointments with proper relationships and displays them in the provider dashboard.

### Data Structure
The appointment data includes:
- Customer information (name, email, phone)
- Service details (title, description, price)
- Appointment status and dates
- Repair descriptions
- Final pricing
- Customer ratings and reviews

## Installation & Setup

1. **Include CSS**: Add to your HTML head section:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/booking-manager.css">
```

2. **Include JavaScript**: Add before closing body tag:
```html
<script src="js/booking-manager.js"></script>
```

3. **Replace Booking Page**: Replace the existing booking page content with the enhanced version from `booking-page-template.html`

4. **Server Routes**: The booking routes are automatically mounted at `/api/bookings` and use your existing appointment controller

**‚úÖ No Mock Data**: The system fetches real appointment data directly from your database through the existing Prisma setup.

## Usage

### Initialize Booking Manager
```javascript
// The booking manager is automatically initialized when the bookings page is loaded
// through the provider dashboard navigation
```

### Manual Initialization
```javascript
// Create a new booking manager instance
const bookingManager = new BookingManager();

// Access the global instance
window.bookingManager.refreshBookings();
```

## Status Flow

```
pending ‚Üí confirmed ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì            ‚Üì
cancelled   cancelled   cancelled
```

## Real Database Integration ‚úÖ

You're absolutely right! The booking system now properly connects to your existing `Appointment` table in the Prisma schema. Here's what was corrected:

### ‚ùå What Was Wrong Before:
- Mock data generation as fallback
- Separate booking controller duplicating appointment logic
- Custom data structures that didn't match your schema

### ‚úÖ What's Correct Now:
- **Direct Database Connection**: Fetches real data from `Appointment` table
- **Reuses Existing Controller**: Uses your `appointmentController.js`
- **Proper Relationships**: Includes customer, service, availability, and rating data
- **No Mock Data**: All data comes from your actual database

### Database Query Example:
```javascript
// Real query to your Appointment table
const appointments = await prisma.appointment.findMany({
    where: { provider_id: providerId },
    include: {
        customer: { select: { first_name: true, last_name: true, email: true, phone_number: true }},
        service: { select: { service_title: true, service_description: true }},
        availability: true,
        appointment_rating: true
    }
});
```

The booking manager now properly displays real appointment data from your database with all the correct relationships and no artificial mock data.
